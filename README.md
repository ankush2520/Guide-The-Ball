# Guide the Ball

A hyper-casual puzzle game. Place a limited number of ramps, then drop the ball
and watch whether your plan lands it in the target. Plan-first, not reflex-based.

**The entire game is [`index.html`](index.html)** — inline CSS and JS, zero
dependencies, no build step. Open it in a browser and it runs. Zip it and it's
ready for CrazyGames / Poki / Softgames.

## Run

    npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
    npm test           # Playwright suite + solver sweep

`npm` is only needed for the tests; the game itself has no toolchain.

## Levels

`LEVELS[]` in [index.html](index.html) holds each level: `id`, `name`, `maxBlocks`,
`spawn`, `obstacles`, `target`, `targetType`. Wall segments are generated from
`targetType` by `buildWalls()` and are **real collidable geometry** — the same
segment-bounce code as player ramps, so they mirror the ball's direction and
never change its speed. Five types, easiest to hardest: `OPEN`, `SIDE_WALL`,
`POCKET`, `NARROW_GAP`, `ENCLOSED`.

Progress (highest level reached) persists in `localStorage` under
`gtb.progress.v1`; blocked storage degrades to "no saving", never a crash.

## Layout

    index.html         the game — everything
    tools/serve.mjs    zero-dep static server for `npm run dev`
    tests/play.test.mjs  Playwright suite: UI, physics invariants, solver sweep
    tests/tune.mjs     physics tuning rig — compares SPEED values on level health
    tests/levels.mjs   per-level design harness — winnability, precision, triviality

## Physics

The ball's **speed is constant for the entire drop** — only direction changes.
Gravity applies a downward nudge to the direction, and the velocity vector is
re-normalised back to `SPEED` every frame and after every collision. This is
deliberate: you commit to ramp placement before watching, so unpredictable
acceleration would make the ball's path impossible to reason about.

`CURVE` is set to **0**: the ball travels in perfectly straight lines and only
changes direction when it hits something. A ramp sets an angle and the ball
holds that angle. Raising `CURVE` bends the path into a downward arc instead
(0.00756 gives a hard 227°/sec curve, which erases the ramp angle in a quarter
of a second). `GRAV_BIAS` is derived as `CURVE × SPEED²`, so trajectory shape
stays fixed when only the speed changes.

The cost of `CURVE = 0` is that a ball knocked horizontal can bounce between the
walls forever; those runs end on the 14s timeout (~8% of careless layouts).

Obstacle hits mirror off the circle like a real bounce, then scatter by up to
`OB_JITTER`, clamped to an outward cone so the ball never re-enters what it hit.

Re-run `npm test` after touching any physics constant — the solver sweep checks
the level stays winnable with a sensible ramp but not winnable by accident.
